* The issues
A couple problems were introduced with the choice of using poweshell cmdlets on windows for the clojure cli.
** The three competing double quote escaping
Powershell is its own world, and while it is possible to run a cmdlet from the regular command shell,
we then have to face 3 competing escaping rules (the shell we're using, powershell, java) for the often necessary
double quotes of a clojure invokation.
People may want to invoke clojure from powershell, the regular command prompt, or some other shells like git bash.
For all but the simplest use cases, Powershell single-handedly defeats that.
** Tools compatibility
There are several major tools that simply do not work on windows because of the powershell. 
It is a fact that most clojure users are not using windows. Tool makers more often than not fall 
into that category. While they are willing to make some allowances for windows, taking into account the quirks of
the powershell situation is maybe a bit too much to ask. In order to reduce friction in this regard, we might want the 
usage patterns to closely ressemble those of linux and mac. The current situation further insulate the windows OS from
the clojure ecosystem. Which is a shame as this is still the most used OS, the one from which new users could more
easily arrive.

I've personally experienced trouble with cider which is (was?) the most used IDE. And with
shadow-cljs, another entry point to the clojure world. These simply do not work with the vanilla clojure cli on windows.
** Competing implementation
The situation is so dire that it even sprouted a competing implementation [[https://github.com/frericksm/clj-windows][Clojure installer and CLI tools for windows]] 
(i'm going on a leg here, not quite sure about the motivations)
** Installation issues
The powershell smodule installation requires the user to lower his system security levels by allowing any powershell scripts
to be run. That's bad practice right there. This may be alleviated somewhat by code signing the ClojureTools module, 
thus reducing the execution policy requirements to AllSigned.
** Not an issue to me !
These issues mostly go away with some work, using the previously mentioned competing implementation we can mostly 
get there for the tooling issue. Sean Corfield has been advertising his workflow and it's obviously working for
him, a professional clojure developer working on windows.

I'll oppose to that the difficulties of a new user, who will be stopped at several points in his journey 
to clojure. It's hard enough to select a good editor, understand the classpath issues, and so on, without 
having to contend with the bizarre discrepencies from the unix world.

I also am a professional clojure developer, and i spent much time on these issue. While this is ok to me,
not everyone has that time.

Windows is competent enough to run a java vm, we can do better.
* Solutions
The goal is to make the dev tools work, that means the command line must work from a regular command shell, and the
quoting must ressemble the one on unix.
There are several levels of solutions. 
- We can completely rewrite the powershell cmdlets in some other language.
- We can keep these around but write a wrapper for their invokation from the regular command line.

|-----------------------------+---------+------------------------------------|

** Wrapper

The goal would be to create both a clojure and clj commands, and place these in the path.
- We can invoke directly the powershell command, facing the 3 quote escaping rules
- Createa temporary ps1 file, having to contend with only 2 escaping rules at a time, but do so twice.
- Use the -EncodedCommand powershell command line

We might be in a position were we need real parsing of the command line to work out the escaping rules.

I went ahead and made an [[https://github.com/cark/clojure-win-cli-wrap][exploratory wrapper]] using Nim. Been using -EncodedCommand, thus avoiding the temp file. 
Works well for me at least !
** Rewrite

We can completely sidestep the powershell issues.

* My opinion
I leaned toward a compiled wrapper, and made one to explore the possibility : [[https://github.com/cark/clojure-win-cli-wrap][exploratory wrapper]] using Nim. Been using -EncodedCommand, thus avoiding the temp file.
It works well enough, but we're still paying the powershell performance tax this way. 

IMO, the perfect solution would be a portable compiled rewrite of the shell script. I'm willing to do it if necessary, though i'm
certainly not the most qualified for the unix parts.

* Disclaimer
- I'm not entirely certain if this fulfills Alex Miller's requirements.
- I winged it on many table cells, i expect some help in filling/amending those judgment calls and adding more dimensions.
- English is not my native language, so yeah approximate spelling !
- I left out the installation part, i'd go with a native windows installer but that's for later i think
